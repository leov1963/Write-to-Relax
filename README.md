## Motivation

I've always enjoyed creative writing but I have difficulty focusing or finding the inspiration to get started. I've explored using various creative writing apps but was always just not quite satisfied with what I found. So what better way of finding an ideal app than making one myself?! I also have a deep love for the out doors and when I spend long hours indoors infront of screens; even a taste of outside is appreciated.
